This is my personal account where I keep some of my personal projects, commonly used code, and presentations while exploring various topics in data science and machine learning.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** fun data science projects on products at Microsoft
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** astronomy, psychology, music theory, and environmental science
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** music, space, pro-environmental, or social justice projects
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Anything! I love to learn, and I've picked up a lot of different things along the way
- 😄 **Pronouns:** He/him
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** My home office was a treehouse for a while (this makes my 8-year old self proud), and I live in the town where Twin Peaks was filmed

Think this account looks young? You're correct! I got locked out of [my old account](https://github.com/JeffMacaluso) after a 2FA mishap, so feel free to head over there if you want to see my history.
